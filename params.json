{"name":"SwiRL-OSX","tagline":"MAC OSX compatible version of SwiRL -- a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system for English.","body":"What is SwiRL-OSX?\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nSwiRL-OSX is a Mac OSX compatible version of the original\r\n[SwiRL](http://www.surdeanu.info/mihai/swirl/) system developed by Mihai Surdeanu.\r\n\r\nThe source is verified to build in OSX Snow Leopard, using gcc 4.2.1.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have WordNet installed and the environment variable $WNHOME is set\r\nto the root of the installation directory.  You can download and install WordNet\r\n[here](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/), then set $WNHOME accordingly.  See example.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ # If you installed wordnet to /usr/local/WordNet-3.0/\r\n$ export WNHOME='/usr/local/WordNet-3.0/'\r\n$ echo $WNHOME\r\n/usr/local/WordNet-3.0/\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor other build errors, please refer to this [FAQ](http://www.surdeanu.info/mihai/swirl/faq.php).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is SwiRL?\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nSwiRL is a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system constructed on top of the full \r\nsyntactic analysis of text. The syntactic analysis is performed using Eugene \r\nCharniak's parser (included in this package). SwiRL trains one classifier for\r\neach argument label using a rich set of syntactic and semantic features. \r\nThe classifiers are learned using one-vs-all AdaBoost classifiers, using\r\nXavier Carreras' AdaBoost software (included in this package).\r\n\r\nWhen tested on the CoNLL evaluation data, SwiRL obtains an F1 measure of\r\n77.44 on the WSJ testing section and of 66.65 on the Brown testing section.\r\nThe execution time is slightly less than 3 seconds/sentence (includes \r\nfull parsing and SRL).\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\nMihai Surdeanu, but this package includes also Eugene Charniak's parser and\r\nXavier Carreras' AdaBoost software.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nFor installation details, please refer to the original [README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trananh/SwiRL-OSX/master/README).\r\n","google":"UA-48101157-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
